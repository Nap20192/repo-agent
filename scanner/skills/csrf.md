# CSRF

Cross-site request forgery abuses ambient authority (cookies, HTTP auth) across origins. Do not rely on CORS alone; enforce non-replayable tokens and strict origin checks for every state change.

## Attack Surface

**Session Types**
- Web apps with cookie-based sessions and HTTP auth
- JSON/REST, GraphQL (GET/persisted queries), file upload endpoints

**Authentication Flows**
- Login/logout, password/email change, MFA toggles

**OAuth/OIDC**
- Authorize, token, logout, disconnect/connect endpoints

## High-Value Targets

- Credentials and profile changes (email/password/phone)
- Payment and money movement, subscription/plan changes
- API key/secret generation, PAT rotation, SSH keys
- 2FA/TOTP enable/disable; backup codes; device trust
- OAuth connect/disconnect; logout; account deletion
- Admin/staff actions and impersonation flows
- File uploads/deletes; access control changes

## Key Vulnerabilities

### Navigation CSRF

- Auto-submitting form to target origin; works when cookies are sent and no token/origin checks are enforced
- Top-level GET navigation can trigger state if server misuses GET or links actions to GET callbacks

### Simple Content-Type CSRF

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` POSTs do not require preflight
- `text/plain` form bodies can slip through validators and be parsed server-side

### JSON CSRF

- If server parses JSON from `text/plain` or form-encoded bodies, craft parameters to reconstruct JSON
- Some frameworks accept JSON keys via form fields (e.g., `data[foo]=bar`) or treat duplicate keys leniently

### Login/Logout CSRF

- Force logout to clear CSRF tokens, then chain login CSRF to bind victim to attacker's account
- Login CSRF: submit attacker credentials to victim's browser; later actions occur under attacker's account

### OAuth/OIDC Flows

- Abuse authorize/logout endpoints reachable via GET or form POST without origin checks
- Exploit relaxed SameSite on top-level navigations
- Open redirects or loose redirect_uri validation can chain with CSRF to force unintended authorizations

### File and Action Endpoints

- File upload/delete often lack token checks; forge multipart requests to modify storage
- Admin actions exposed as simple POST links are frequently CSRFable

### GraphQL CSRF

- If queries/mutations are allowed via GET or persisted queries, exploit top-level navigation with encoded payloads
- Batched operations may hide mutations within a nominally safe request

### WebSocket CSRF

- Browsers send cookies on WebSocket handshake
- Enforce Origin checks server-side; without them, cross-site pages can open authenticated sockets and issue actions

## Special Contexts

### Mobile/SPA

- Deep links and embedded WebViews may auto-send cookies; trigger actions via crafted intents/links
- SPAs that rely solely on bearer tokens are less CSRF-prone, but hybrid apps mixing cookies and APIs can still be vulnerable

### Integrations

- Webhooks and back-office tools sometimes expose state-changing GETs intended for staff
- Confirm CSRF defenses there too

## Validation

1. Demonstrate a cross-origin page that triggers a state change without user interaction beyond visiting
2. Show that removing the anti-CSRF control (token/header) is accepted, or that Origin/Referer are not verified
3. Prove behavior across at least two browsers or contexts (top-level nav vs XHR/fetch)
4. Provide before/after state evidence for the same account
5. If defenses exist, show the exact condition under which they are bypassed (content-type, method override, null Origin)

## False Positives

- Token verification present and required; Origin/Referer enforced consistently
- No cookies sent on cross-site requests (SameSite=Strict, no HTTP auth) and no state change via simple requests
- Only idempotent, non-sensitive operations affected

## Impact

- Account state changes (email/password/MFA), session hijacking via login CSRF
- Financial operations, administrative actions
- Durable authorization changes (role/permission flips, key rotations) and data loss

## Pro Tips

1. Prefer preflightless vectors (form-encoded, multipart, text/plain) and top-level GET if available
2. Test login/logout, OAuth connect/disconnect, and account linking first
3. Validate Origin/Referer behavior explicitly; do not assume frameworks enforce them
4. Toggle SameSite and observe differences across navigation vs XHR
5. For GraphQL, attempt GET queries or persisted queries that carry mutations
6. Always try method overrides and parser differentials
7. Combine with clickjacking when visual confirmations block CSRF

## Summary

CSRF is eliminated only when state changes require a secret the attacker cannot supply and the server verifies the caller's origin. Tokens and Origin checks must hold across methods, content-types, and transports.
