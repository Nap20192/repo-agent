# Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)

BFLA is action-level authorization failure: callers invoke functions (endpoints, mutations, admin tools) they are not entitled to. It appears when enforcement differs across transports, gateways, roles, or when services trust client hints. Bind subject × action at the service that performs the action.

## Attack Surface

- Vertical authz: privileged/admin/staff-only actions reachable by basic users
- Feature gates: toggles enforced at edge/UI, not at core services
- Transport drift: REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC vs WebSocket with inconsistent checks
- Gateway trust: backends trust X-User-Id/X-Role injected by proxies/edges
- Background workers/jobs performing actions without re-checking authz

## High-Value Actions

- Role/permission changes, impersonation/sudo, invite/accept into orgs
- Approve/void/refund/credit issuance, price/plan overrides
- Export/report generation, data deletion, account suspension/reactivation
- Feature flag toggles, quota/grant adjustments, license/seat changes
- Security settings: 2FA reset, email/phone verification overrides

## Key Vulnerabilities

### Verb Drift and Aliases

- Alternate methods: GET performing state change; POST vs PUT vs PATCH differences; X-HTTP-Method-Override/_method
- Alternate endpoints performing the same action with weaker checks (legacy vs v2, mobile vs web)

### Edge vs Core Mismatch

- Edge blocks an action but core service RPC accepts it directly; call internal service via exposed API route or SSRF
- Gateway-injected identity headers override token claims; supply conflicting headers to test precedence

### Feature Flag Bypass

- Client-checked feature gates; call backend endpoints directly
- Admin-only mutations exposed but hidden in UI; invoke via GraphQL or gRPC tools

### Batch Job Paths

- Create export/import jobs where creation is allowed but finalize/approve lacks authz; finalize others' jobs
- Replay webhooks/background tasks endpoints that perform privileged actions without verifying caller

### Content-Type Paths

- JSON vs form vs multipart handlers using different middleware: send the action via the most permissive parser

## Validation

1. Show a lower-privileged principal successfully invokes a restricted action (same inputs) while the proper role succeeds and another lower role fails
2. Provide evidence across at least two transports or encodings demonstrating inconsistent enforcement
3. Demonstrate that removing/altering client-side gates (buttons/flags) does not affect backend success
4. Include durable state change proof: before/after snapshots, audit logs, and authoritative sources

## False Positives

- Read-only endpoints mislabeled as admin but publicly documented
- Feature toggles intentionally open to all roles for preview/beta with clear policy
- Simulated environments where admin endpoints are stubbed with no side effects

## Impact

- Privilege escalation to admin/staff actions
- Monetary/state impact: refunds/credits/approvals without authorization
- Tenant-wide configuration changes, impersonation, or data deletion
- Compliance and audit violations due to bypassed approval workflows

## Pro Tips

1. Start from the role matrix; test every action with basic vs admin tokens across REST/GraphQL/gRPC
2. Diff middleware stacks between routes; weak chains often exist on legacy or alternate encodings
3. Inspect gateways for identity header injection; never trust client-provided identity
4. Treat jobs/webhooks as first-class: finalize/approve must re-check the actor
5. Prefer minimal PoCs: one request that flips a privileged field or invokes an admin method with a basic token

## Summary

Authorization must bind the actor to the specific action at the service boundary on every request and message. UI gates, gateways, or prior steps do not substitute for function-level checks.
