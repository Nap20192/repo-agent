# Prototype Pollution

Prototype pollution corrupts shared object prototypes (`Object.prototype`, `Array.prototype`, etc.), leading to application logic bypass, denial of service, and — on Node.js — remote code execution via gadget chains. Test anywhere user input merges into objects without safe key filtering.

## Attack Surface

**Languages & Runtimes**
- JavaScript/TypeScript (browser and Node.js)
- JSON parsers that preserve `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` keys
- Server-side template engines and config merge utilities

**Input Vectors**
- JSON request bodies, query strings, multipart form fields
- URL-encoded nested objects (`__proto__[key]=value`)
- WebSocket messages, GraphQL variables, file import formats (JSON, YAML)

**Vulnerable Patterns**
- Deep merge/extend: `lodash.merge`, `jQuery.extend`, custom `Object.assign` loops
- Query parsers: `qs`, `body-parser` with nested object support
- Client-side routing, state hydration, analytics SDK config merges

## Key Vulnerabilities

### Client-Side Prototype Pollution

**Gadget Effects**
- Bypass auth checks reading `user.isAdmin` when polluted on prototype
- DOM XSS via polluted properties consumed by `innerHTML`, `document.write`, script loaders
- Cookie/session manipulation if app reads config from polluted defaults

**Payload Shapes**
```json
{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}
{"constructor": {"prototype": {"isAdmin": true}}}
{"__proto__.polluted": "yes"}
```

**URL-encoded (qs-style)**
```
?__proto__[isAdmin]=true
?constructor[prototype][isAdmin]=true
```

### Server-Side Prototype Pollution (Node.js)

**Common Sinks**
- `lodash.merge`, `lodash.defaultsDeep`, `deep-extend`, `merge-options`
- Express/query parsers accepting nested objects
- YAML `load()` (not `safeLoad`) with prototype keys
- JSON.parse → merge into existing object without null prototype

**RCE Gadget Chains (Node.js)**
Pollute properties consumed by child_process, template engines, or require paths:
```json
{"__proto__": {"shell": "/proc/self/exe", "argv0": "node", "NODE_OPTIONS": "--require /tmp/evil.js"}}
{"__proto__": {"outputFunctionName": "x;process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id')//"}}
```

Gadget availability depends on package versions — enumerate `node_modules` in white-box scans.

### Filter Bypasses

**Key Sanitization Bypasses**
- Unicode normalization: `__proto__` variants, fullwidth underscores
- Nested forms: `constructor.prototype` instead of `__proto__`
- Array pollution: `__proto__[0]`, `[].__proto__`
- JSON `$` or `.` keys in some parsers (MongoDB-style operators overlap — see nosql_injection skill)

**Freeze/Seal Gaps**
- Pollution before `Object.freeze` on instance but not prototype
- Pollution affecting newly created objects after merge

## Validation

1. Demonstrate a property on `Object.prototype` (or relevant prototype) affecting behavior on unrelated objects
2. Show security impact: auth bypass, XSS execution, or server-side command execution with minimal PoC
3. Prove pollution persists across requests (server) or page lifetime (client) as applicable
4. Document exact merge function and input path (parameter name, content-type)
5. Confirm fix: null-prototype objects, `Object.create(null)`, or key blocklists on `__proto__`/`constructor`/`prototype`

## False Positives

- Parser strips `__proto__` before merge — marker property never appears on prototype
- Framework uses `Object.create(null)` for options objects throughout
- Polluted key visible in JSON echo but never merged into object graph
- Client-side pollution blocked by frozen prototypes in modern hardened libraries (verify no behavioral change)
- WAF blocks payload but alternate encoding also blocked consistently

## Impact

- Authentication/authorization bypass via polluted flag checks
- DOM XSS and session compromise in browsers
- Remote code execution on Node.js through known gadget chains
- Denial of service via polluting widely read prototype properties

## Pro Tips

1. Always verify pollution with a unique canary key (`pollutionCanary_<random>`) before attempting RCE gadgets
2. In white-box scans, grep for `merge`, `extend`, `defaultsDeep`, `assign` with user input
3. Check both request parsing and response template config merges (second-order)
4. Node gadget chains are version-specific — confirm package version before claiming RCE
5. Combine with client-side template injection if polluted keys flow into rendering config

## Summary

Any unsafe recursive merge of user-controlled keys is a prototype pollution candidate. Block `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` keys, use null-prototype objects, and validate impact with behavioral proof — not just reflected keys.
