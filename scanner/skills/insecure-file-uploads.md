# Insecure File Uploads

Upload surfaces are high risk: server-side execution (RCE), stored XSS, malware distribution, storage takeover, and DoS. Modern stacks mix direct-to-cloud uploads, background processors, and CDNs—authorization and validation must hold across every step.

## Attack Surface

- Web/mobile/API uploads, direct-to-cloud (S3/GCS/Azure) presigned flows, resumable/multipart protocols (tus, S3 MPU)
- Image/document/media pipelines (ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick, Ghostscript, ExifTool, PDF engines, office converters)
- Admin/bulk importers, archive uploads (zip/tar), report/template uploads, rich text with attachments
- Serving paths: app directly, object storage, CDN, email attachments, previews/thumbnails

## Detection Channels

### Server Execution

- Web shell execution (language dependent), config/handler uploads (.htaccess, .user.ini, web.config) enabling execution
- Interpreter-side template/script evaluation during conversion (ImageMagick/Ghostscript/ExifTool)

### Client Execution

- Stored XSS via SVG/HTML/JS if served inline without correct headers; PDF JavaScript; office macros in previewers

### Header and Render

- Missing X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff enabling browser sniff to script
- Content-Type reflection from upload vs server-set; Content-Disposition: inline vs attachment

### Process Side Effects

- AV/CDR race or absence; background job status allows access before scan completes; password-protected archives bypass scanning

## Special Contexts

### Rich Text Editors

- RTEs allow image/attachment uploads and embed links; verify sanitization and serving headers

### Mobile Clients

- Mobile SDKs may send nonstandard MIME or metadata; servers sometimes trust client-side transformations

### Serverless and CDN

- Direct-to-bucket uploads with Lambda/Workers post-processing; verify security decisions are not delegated to frontends
- CDN caching of uploaded content; ensure correct cache keys and headers

## Validation

1. Demonstrate execution or rendering of active content: web shell reachable, or SVG/HTML executing JS when viewed
2. Show filter bypass: upload accepted despite restrictions with evidence on retrieval
3. Prove header weaknesses: inline rendering without nosniff or missing attachment
4. Show race or pipeline gap: access before AV/CDR; extraction outside intended directory
5. Provide reproducible steps: request/response for upload and subsequent access

## False Positives

- Upload stored but never served back; or always served as attachment with strict nosniff
- Converters run in locked-down sandboxes with no external IO and no script engines
- AV/CDR blocks the payload and quarantines; access before scan is impossible by design

## Impact

- Remote code execution on application stack or media toolchain host
- Persistent cross-site scripting and session/token exfiltration via served uploads
- Malware distribution via public storage/CDN; brand/reputation damage
- Data loss or corruption via overwrite/zip slip; service degradation via zip bombs

## Pro Tips

1. Keep PoCs minimal: tiny SVG/HTML for XSS, a single-line PHP/ASP where relevant
2. Always capture download response headers and final MIME; that decides browser behavior
3. Prefer transforming risky formats to safe renderings (SVG→PNG) rather than complex sanitization
4. In presigned flows, constrain all headers and object keys server-side
5. For archives, extract in a chroot/jail with explicit allowlist; drop symlinks and reject traversal
6. Test finalize/complete steps in resumable flows; many validations only run on init
7. Verify background processors with EICAR and tiny polyglots
8. When you cannot get execution, aim for stored XSS or header-driven script execution
9. Validate that CDNs honor attachment/nosniff
10. Document full pipeline behavior per asset type
11. Reproduce detector/consumer mismatches on the deployed library versions; OS packages and language bindings may ship different limits

## Summary

Secure uploads are a pipeline property. Enforce strict type, size, and header controls; transform or strip active content; never execute or inline-render untrusted uploads; and keep storage private with controlled, signed access.
